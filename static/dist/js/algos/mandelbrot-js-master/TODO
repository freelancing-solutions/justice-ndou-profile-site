- Ability to minimize settings console
- Let dragging work outside window boundaries
- Enable Julia rendering
- Let dragging work over description and info box areas
- Detect slow renderings and display ETA for them
- Fix the auto-iterations function; consider creating an expanded polynomial
  for it.
- Add right-click to zoom out (instead of shift-click)
- Add panning
- Only render new parts when panning
  (maintain startx and stopx in an array[height of canvas],
   update this array when panning has finished, and then restart
   rendering. Rendering updates this array when a scanline has
   been copied to the canvas).
- When resizing window, scale up the canvas bitmap before rerendering.
